### Software
- [2DX](http://www.2dx.unibas.ch)
> 2dx is an initiative that aims at facilitating computer image processing in electron crystallography. 

- [EMAN2](http://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/EMAN2)
> EMAN2 is a scientific image processing suite with a primary focus on processing TEM image data.  It performs single-particle reconstruction, subtomogram averaging, and various tools useful in other subdisciplines. 

- [Phenix](https://www.phenix-online.org)
> PHENIX (Python-based Hierarchical ENvironment for Integrated Xtallography) is a software suite for the automated determination of molecular structures using X-ray crystallography and other methods.

- [Relion](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php/Main_Page)
> RELION (for REgularised LIkelihood OptimisatioN) is a stand-alone program that employs an empirical Bayesian approach to refinement of (multiple) 3D reconstructions or 2D class averages in cryo-EM.   

- [UCSF Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/)
